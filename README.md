* A very simple scraper for getting some IT related jobs in Singapore from JobsCentral
* It can help you automating job queries and never miss a new job anymore by making this a cron job
* The scraper writes the findings in a database (or also a CSV file by removing the #)
* The example uses Amazon AWS. You have to enter your credentials in the connection string
